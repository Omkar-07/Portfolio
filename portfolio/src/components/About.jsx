    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Omkar Patil, a passionate and career-minded full-stack developer with expertise in Java, Python, 
      JavaScript, and MySQL. I specialize in building dynamic, user-friendly web applications using Spring Boot, 
      HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have developed projects such as a hand gesture-controlled media player, a wall-breaker GUI game, and a 
      property management system using Spring Boot. My research on Human-Computer Interaction has been published 
      in the International Journal of Research and Analytical Reviews (IJRAR).
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am enhancing my skills in Java Full-Stack Development at IT Vedant Institute. I hold 
      certifications in Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and Web Development. I am eager to contribute to innovative 
      projects that align with my technical expertise and passion for software development.
